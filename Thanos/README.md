### version 1.0. [anonymEngine_v1.0.jar] ###

THANOS is an automated tool, developed in Java Standard Edition, that allows the execution of a set of widely-used anonymization, pseudonymization, and de-identification  mechanisms that allow processing the data without compromising the confidentiality of individuals, while also trying to retain the utility of the data for a variety of analytical tasks. The selected mechanisms consist in transforming personal data (manipulating or removing attributes) such that it cannot be linked to data subjects (i.e., break the linkage with real world identities).
