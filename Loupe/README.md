### version 1.0. [codeplag_v1.0.jar] ###

LOUPE is an automated system, developed in Java Standard Edition, that addresses the common usage limitations of source code plagiarism detection tools. LOUPE shields the users from the complexity and burden of properly configure the tools by providing a unified approach to run several different tools  simultaneously  for  multiple  pieces  of  work (including historical data). The system automatically  gathers the tools’outputs, consolidates their relevant information (considering users’ preferences), and  presents a useful data visualization that includes a comparative view of the tools. 

More details about the tool and how it has been used in experiments of plagiarism detection can be found at the following papers:
